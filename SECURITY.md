## Low priority Vulnerabilitys

If there is a security vulnerability that won't cause damage, make a issue and I'll try to fix it.
Please add as much info as you can about the issue or bug to make fixes easier.

## High priority Vulnerabilitys
Make a private report and start working on a patch. If I can help you, I will, but you probably know more than me.
After you have submitted a report, you should get contributor permissions. You should hear back from me in 1-2 days.
